# CS50w Project 0

## Purpose

This static personal website is built for Mr Chris Wong, my classical guitar teacher, for his publicity and student recruitment purposes.

## Structure

The website has the following structure:

- Landing
  - for immediate contact
- About
  - for introduction
- Teaching
  - for student recruitment
- Portfolio
  - for showing his guitar repertoire.

## Feature

- Bootstrap
  - This site use bootstrap as is the main source of style.
- Grid box system
  - The site has a two columns layout by using grid box.
- Responsive
  - The left column will be hidden when the browser screen shrinks to the breaking point.
  - The portfolio list `flex-direction` changes to `column` when the breaking point is met.

The site itself does not store any `.mp3` for display, instead, we link all the demonstration to Youtube to increase the site performance.
